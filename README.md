# `@replit/ruspty` - PTY for Bun (and Node) through Rust FFI

Running:

- `bun install`
- `bun run build`
- `bun test`

The code mainly targets Bun, but does work in Node too.

The Rust PTY implementation is cargo-culted from [Alacritty's Unix TTY code](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/master/alacritty_terminal/src/tty/unix.rs).
