 *
 * const pty = new Pty('sh', [], ENV, CWD, { rows: 24, cols: 80 }, (...result) => {

 * const read = new fs.createReadStream('', {
 *   fd: pty.fd(),
 *   start: 0,
 *   highWaterMark: 16 * 1024,
 *   autoClose: true,
 * });
 * const write = new fs.createWriteStream('', {
 *   fd: pty.fd(),
 *   autoClose: true,
 * });
 *
 * read.on('data', (chunk) => {
 *   // TODO: Handle data.
 * });
 * read.on('error', (err) => {
 *   if (err.code && err.code.indexOf('EIO') !== -1) {
 *     // This is expected to happen when the process exits.
 *     return;
 *   }

 *
 * The last parameter (a callback that gets stdin chunks) is optional and is only there for
 * compatibility with bun 1.1.7.
